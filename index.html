            <p>For many people, working as a web designer sounds like a dream job. It's a career where you'll get to
                show off your passion and creativityâ€”and get paid well for doing so! But becoming a web designer
                requires a wide array of skills, which are best attained through web designer courses.
                By completing a web designer diploma program, you'll take yourself one step closer to that moment when
                you can begin designing websites. So how can courses prepare you for your journey, and help make your
                dream job a reality? Let's take a look.
                Obviously, creativity is a skill that web designers need since they create websites that are visually
                appealing. You may be a naturally gifted artist and have a passion for design, but if not, you can still
                learn the creative skills. For example, in your courses, you'll learn about colour theory, during which
                you'll gain skills in colour manipulation and how to use colour to give your work credibility and
                sophistication.</p>

            <h1>without limits</h1>
            <p>There are only a handful of careers that offer legitimate stay-at-home opportunities for professionals.
                Web design is one of them. If you're not a big fan of the 9-5 daily grind [or 8-5 if you're forced to
                take a 1 hour unpaid lunch], then going freelance as a web designer could be right for you. You'll still
                need to meet certain obligations for your clients, but you'll have a lot more freedom to work when you
                want to work.Web designers can take projects from any business in virtually any industry today. The top
                choices tend to be scientific, government, tech services, or general sales, but anything from
                construction to a personal blog can all become something that you can work on. This limits the
                repetitive boredom that can strike many other career opportunities in our fast paced world today.
                By the year 2026, there is an expected 20% job growth in this industry. If you're unemployed or
                under-employed right now, then the time is right to consider a switch over to this field.</p>

            <h1>Global Community</h1>
            <p>If you want to grow as a developer, I can't over-emphasize the benefits of joining a developer community.
                There are many advantages, from peer-programming to sharing knowledge, mentorship, sharing support,
                sharing tools, code reviews, answering questions, and much more.Communities are usually built on shared
                struggles of individuals learning in a particular region, and the goals of each community differ per the
                individual's collective needs.Over the years, these developer communities have grown across the world
                with different goals and missions but still with the general aim of providing a platform for developers
                to learn, interact, share ideas, support each other and grow."If you want to go quickly, go alone. If
                you want to go far, go together." by African Proverb.To better help those looking out for communities to
                join, I have put together a list of 20 best communities in no particular order ranging from Engineering,
                Design, Data Science, Machine Learning, Developer Relations, Technical Writing, and more.</p>
